# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Backend

## 🚀 Objective
This backend is the foundation for the **Airbnb Clone Project**, designed to manage users, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. It supports robust functionality to mirror the core experience of Airbnb for both guests and hosts.

---

## 🏆 Project Goals
- **User Management:** Secure user registration, authentication, and profile handling.
- **Property Management:** Host property listings with full CRUD capabilities.
- **Booking System:** Reserve and manage stays, including check-in/check-out flows.
- **Payment Processing:** Handle secure payments for bookings.
- **Review System:** Allow guests to rate and review stays.
- **Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient queries and scalability using caching and indexing.

## 🧠 Database Design

The core entities and their relationships:

### 📄 Entities & Fields

- **User**
  - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`
  - A user can host multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

- **Property**
  - `id`, `host_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`
  - Belongs to a user (host), and can have many bookings and reviews.

- **Booking**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status`
  - Connects a user with a property and tracks reservation details.

- **Payment**
  - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_status`, `timestamp`
  - Associated with a booking; ensures payment is tracked.

- **Review**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  - Tied to both user and property.

**Relationships**:
- One user can list many properties.
- One user can make many bookings.
- A booking is linked to one user and one property.
- A payment is linked to one booking.
- A review is linked to one user and one property.

## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Handles registration, login, and profile updates. Secure authentication and authorization are applied to protect user accounts.

### 2. Property Management
Enables users (hosts) to create, update, and delete property listings with relevant details, ensuring guests can find places to stay.

### 3. Booking System
Allows guests to reserve properties for a specified date range. Handles logic for check-in, check-out, availability, and booking statuses.

### 4. Payment Processing
Processes booking payments securely using integrated payment gateways. Ensures transaction records are linked to bookings.

### 5. Review System
Allows guests to rate their stay and provide written feedback. These reviews are visible to other users to build trust.

### 6. API Documentation
REST APIs are documented using OpenAPI and DRF. GraphQL offers an alternative flexible way to query data.

### 7. Database Optimization
Implements indexing and caching (Redis) to ensure fast data retrieval and reduced load on the database.

## 🔐 API Security

### Key Measures
- **Authentication**: Using token-based authentication (JWT or session-based) to ensure only verified users can access protected endpoints.
- **Authorization**: Only property owners can modify their listings; only guests can leave reviews for places they’ve booked.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting API calls per user/IP.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.

### Importance
- **User Data Protection**: Secure credentials and private information.
- **Booking & Payment Security**: Prevent fraud or manipulation of bookings and payments.
- **System Integrity**: Keeps the platform stable and resilient against attacks.

## 🛠 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates testing and deployment of code changes, ensuring high-quality, reliable releases.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and builds on every pull request and push.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent development, testing, and production environments.
- **Heroku / AWS / Render**: For deployment.

### Benefits
- Faster integration of features and bug fixes.
- Automated checks prevent broken code from reaching production.
- Ensures every push meets project standards.

---

## 👥 Team Roles

### 1. **Backend Developer**
- Implements API endpoints, core logic, and integrations.
- Ensures adherence to project architecture and business rules.

### 2. **Database Administrator (DBA)**
- Designs the database schema, optimizes queries, manages indexes and migrations.

### 3. **DevOps Engineer**
- Sets up the deployment pipeline, manages server infrastructure, and monitors performance.

### 4. **QA Engineer**
- Writes automated and manual tests, identifies bugs, and verifies functionality.

### 5. **Project Manager (Optional)**
- Coordinates tasks, manages timelines, and ensures all team members meet deliverables.
